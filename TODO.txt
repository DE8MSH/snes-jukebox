* Fix memory issues and uncomment portWriteMenu

* Figure out why the annoying sample loops happen on uploading the bootloader

* Implement basic menu (file select is only part of this!)


* Address speed of FileListMenu::countFiles()
 - Remove this and replace it with dynamic counting?

* Mode switch function
 - Switch between SD, LCD, APU, and Controller

* Confirm SPC file upload?
 - Screen would show info on the song before upload

* Load cover art from SD card

* Get better icons for file selection menu
 - 8x8? (16-bit 565 color)
 - Needed icons:
   - Folder
   - SPC File
   - Non-SPC File
   - Selection Reticule
   - A/B/X/Y/Start/Select

* Bigger, better menu system
 - Direct port write menu
   - "Set" and "one-shot" modes
   - Write more than one port at once?
 - SPC Info ("Now Playing")

* Progress bar for SPC uploads


Other considerations
 - SPC/LCD SPI speed
