This folder contains a wealth of information regarding the hardware setup of the SNES Jukebox. The important items are:

Photos
 - Folder containing photographs of the finished device
Reference Images
 - Folder containing useful SNES reference images for your wiring convenience
APU Pinout.txt
 - The pinout of the SNES APU. Pro tip: The pin numbers are printed on the SNES motherboard. Pay attention when you remove it!
Jukebox Screen Support.stl
 - A 3D-printable support structure for the LCD screen module. It fits pretty tight though. I may tweak this in the future.
SNES Jukebox.sch
 - An EAGLE schematic file for the entire project. You can get EAGLE here for free: http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/
 - WARNING: The schematic WAS NOT drawn when I built the device! I came back and reverse engineered it from my code and reference Arduino schematics, as well as by looking at the device itself. THIS IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE ACCURATE. Please double-check all wiring before powering anything on or committing to a design. I accept no responsibility for damaged components or non-functioning assemblies. Use at your own risk and double-check everything!
